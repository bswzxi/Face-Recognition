# Real-Time Face Recognition with OpenCV and face_recognition
This project demonstrates a real-time face recognition system using the face_recognition and OpenCV libraries in Python. It identifies known faces from a webcam feed and highlights them with a name label.

# Features
Real-time face recognition: Detects and labels faces in real-time using your webcam.
Known face encoding: Loads face encodings from images stored in a folder and compares them with detected faces.
Customizable resolution: Adjust the webcam resolution.
Efficient processing: Frames are resized to increase processing speed while maintaining detection accuracy.

#Dependencies
OpenCV for real-time video processing.
face_recognition library for face detection and recognition.
numpy for numerical computations.
